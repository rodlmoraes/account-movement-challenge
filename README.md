# account-movement-challenge

This repo is solving the challenge from iugu at https://github.com/iugu/account_movement_challenge

To run the code, just go to the folder in your terminal and execute `ruby main.rb`

Then you will questions about the name of the files, if you have your custom input, just type the name or path you want to use,
if you are using the tests that I left here, it will be `contas.csv` and then `transacoes.csv`

The result will be shown as a Hash, with the Account ID and the final account balance in centavos de reais

### Feel free to change the data in the csv files and see other possible cases!

The only lib I'm using is the `'csv'` from ruby, to read the CSV files
